# ðŸ’¤ Logger
> ðŸ“œ An application that extracts the IP address through requests and logs the information using discord webhooks

# ðŸ’« Information
The application obtains the IP address of the computer on which the executable is running and sends it through discord webhooks, this application was only made for study purposes so I do not see the need to add additions, although I will be considering the idea of improving some things

# ðŸ“– Instructions
+ Install and add libcurl to your project. (it is recommended to use vcpkg)

+ In the Logger > Main.cpp file, place your webhook URL on line 10.
